# AI-Prosthetic-vision

Computer Vision developed a lot in the field of Generative learning , Body pose models as well 3D image
mapping . Even we can generate inbuild AR/VR by using the power AI and Computer Vision. So this project is also based on similar concept but on the forensic and prosthetic concept .First of all prosthetics are creating similar human masks that create no difference with the actual face not even from the fitting points . Facial prosthetics helps a lott in media as well security industry along with health IT in curing patients with multiple problems including disability ,mental problems as well facial de formations and so on !
Apart from Prosthetics , we are far away developed in the field of Argumented and virtual reality! We all are using automated apps as well platforms to create vision into reality .This projects of AI prosthetic vision is developed to integrate the power of computer vision , Face map generator by the light of prosthetics in the power of Face mesh algorithm.This is specially designed to help patients with cognitive impairment and to help police to extract face maps from the face sketch of criminals !
